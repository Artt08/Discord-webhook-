# Discord-webhook-
A simple chrome extension to send messages in discord channels using webhook function.

## Download & installation

##### Chromium based browser
Download the latest release in the [releases section](https://github.com//releases) or clone the repo.

You have to install the extension manually:

- Go in manage extension (**chrome://extensions/** in chrome)
- Make sure **Developer mode** is enabled
- Hit **Load unpacked extension** and select the unzipped folder of the extension.

If you use Chromium (not Chrome), you can pack the extension to get a .crx file you can drag & drop inside extensions page (which removes the need to have a dedicated directory for the extension on your hard drive)

- Unzip the extension
- In the parent directory of the extension, run the following command : `chromium --pack-extension=TwitchNoSub`
- Drop the created crx file in the extensions page of your browser (make sure **Developer mode** is enabled, however it will not work)
